# üöö MobChipLite
> Minecraft Entity AI and Bosses Library for 1.17 and above

> MobChipLite is a fork of the original MobChip library, which was created by [gmitch215](https://github.com/gmitch215) (formerly known as GamerCoder215). MobChipLite is a continuation of the original library, with some features and versions removed, but the ultimate goal of updating it to work with the latest versions of Minecraft. Most of the remainder of the README still refers to original MobChip, but the information will still be kept up-to-date.
